## 🛠️ Installation
### **1️⃣ Prerequisites**
Ensure you have **Python 3.12+** and `pip` installed. Recommended to use **conda** or **virtual environments**.

### **2️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Automated-Trading-System.git
cd Automated-Trading-System
```

### **3️⃣ Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

### **4️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage
### **1️⃣ Run the Streamlit App**
```bash
streamlit run Home.py
```
This will launch the **Automated Trading System Dashboard** in your browser.

### **2️⃣ Run the Machine Learning Model Training**
To train a new model using `ml_model.py`, run the following command:
```bash
python ml_model.py AAPL
```
Replace `AAPL` with the desired stock ticker to train a new model for that stock.

### **3️⃣ Navigate the Dashboard**
- **📄 Overview** – Learn about the system.  
- **📡 Core Features** – Explore available functionalities.  
- **📈 Live Trading Page** – View real-time stock predictions.  
- **📉 Trading Strategy** – Simulate investment strategies.

## 🔬 Technology Stack
- **🧠 Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`
- **📊 Data Handling:** `pandas`, `numpy`
- **💻 Backend:** `Streamlit`

## 🏗️ Machine Learning Model Architecture
The model is built using **XGBoost**, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, trained on historical stock price data. The architecture follows these steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleans and prepares stock market data.
2. **Feature Engineering** – Extracts important features like moving averages, RSI, and momentum indicators.
3. **Model Training** – Uses XGBoost to train a predictive model for stock price movement.
4. **Prediction & Evaluation** – Generates forecasts and evaluates accuracy with backtesting.
